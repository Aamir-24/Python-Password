# Python Password

![Code correctness](https://github.com/AnonymousX86/Python-Password/workflows/Code%20correctness/badge.svg)

**This project is my first desktop app - password manager. It's made with Python 3.7 and [material design standard](https://material.io/).**

## What's the program about?

Python Password is intended to safely store passwords. They are encrypted with two master passwords and saved locally.
Master passwords could be randomly generated or set by user, so you can re-create them when they're gone for some reasons
or you'd like to share your passwords with someone. Of course many users on the same PC will have separate data folders.
When you would like to get any password it won't be prompted on the screen, but safely copied to clipboard with no risk
that someone could view your password.As you know that youre password save on system ,so we give an option to configure and
logint to youre account directly from this app you just have to give auto login permistion to your account you can disable this 
featers from setting.there is also a option for dark theam.
