### What is the program about?

Python Password is intended to safely store passwords.

### How does it work?

Program is saving passwords to local database (SQLite database). Passwords are encrypted with a secret key, based on
master password and salt, both could be a user input or random values, so you can re-create the file when it's gone for
some reasons. When you would like to get any password it won't be prompted on the screen, but safely copied to
clipboard.
